# Project Name #
Car Lifecycle Chain (clc).
## Heading ##
  > Car Lifecycle Chain (clc).
## Sub-Heading ##
  > describe what the car goes throw from manufacture to scrap.
## Summary ##
  > this will be a blockchain application that will describe the car life-cycle from manufacture to scrap, including the major incidents like accidents, maintenance, etc.
## Problem ##
  > 
1- it’s too time consuming to take the car to the mechanic to have it inspected before buying it.
2- Sometime the data could be tampered with to benifit a certain party.

## Solution ##
  > First things first, having all the data about the car lifecycle in one blockchain, saves time and effort. Second things second, with blockchain being hard to modify, so you can make sure the data is correct and wasn’t modified. 
## Quote from You ##
  > "Why go to the mechanic if you can see the car lifecycle from your home comfort"
## How to Get Started ##
  > Just by having the chassis number, you can get all info about your car, or the car you want to buy.
## Customer Quote ##
  > Provide a quote from a hypothetical customer that describes how they experienced the benefit.
## Closing and Call to Action ##
  > " I almost fell in the trap of a buying a bad second-hand car, but going to CLC saved me from buying a car that’d spend more time in the garage than on the road".
